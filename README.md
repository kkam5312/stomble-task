# Stomble task - basic login flow

Stombleâ€™s engineering task:

1. You must create a mobile or desktop application. We recommend using react native with expo for ease of running the mobile application.

2. The application should have an authentication flow. Users should be able to signup and login with basic information (you can decide what information is required but you will need to justify it. _Password creation is required_)

3. You will have to implement at least one third-party login option including but not limited too: Facebook, Google and so on.

4. You will need to provide us access to view your source code and run your application on either Gitlab or GitHub. _If possible, please deploy the task to an active link so we can click and use your task as intended to trial it and see it in action_.

Technical Stack Required:

- Frontend: React Native or React.js.
- Backend: Typescript or Javascript.
- Storing your code on Gitlab.
- Uploading the finished task to a free account on AWS.
